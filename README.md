This research aims to understand the genetic basis of quantitative resistance (QR) to blackleg in Brassica napus and its interplay with major blackleg resistance genes such as Rlm9 and Rlm12, which are associated with qualitative resistance. Given the increasing threat of blackleg disease and the limitations of current resistance strategies, this study will use genetic mapping, comparative, and functional genomics to identify and characterize QR loci and candidate genes. It will also investigate resistance gene analogues (RGAs) across the U-triangle of Brassica species and newly sequenced wild Brassicaceae genomes, exploring their diversity, distribution, and structural variation to support the development of more resilient canola cultivars.
